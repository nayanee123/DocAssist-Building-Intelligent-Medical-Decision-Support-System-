# DocAssist-Building-Intelligent-Medical-Decision-Support-System-
The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent medical decision support system that analyzes patient data to assist doctors in making informed decisions about the best treatment options for individual patients. By leveraging machine learning and data analysis, the system will provide personalized treatment recommendations based on the patient's medical history, symptoms, lab results, and other relevant factors.
Focus Areas:

	Data Collection: Gathered patient data from electronic health records (EHRs), medical databases, and other relevant sources.

	Data Preprocessing: Cleaned, normalized, and handled missing values in the patient data to prepare it for analysis.

	Feature Engineering: Identified and extracted meaningful features from the patient data, such as demographic information, medical history, diagnostic test results, and medication history.

	Model Development: Developed machine learning models to predict treatment outcomes based on patient data.

	Treatment Recommendations: Created an algorithm that generates treatment recommendations for individual patients based on the model predictions.

	Model Interpretability: Implemented methods to interpret the model's predictions and provide insights to doctors.
